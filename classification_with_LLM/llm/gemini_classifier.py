## Task
Analyze the email content and classify it into one of the following 8 business intents related to real estate operations:

1. Intent_Lease_Abstraction - Extract lease metadata and clauses (rent, term, landlord, tenant, renewal)
2. Intent_Comparison_LOI_Lease - Compare Letter of Intent with final lease to identify deviations  
3. Intent_Clause_Protect - Detect risky or missing lease clauses (subletting rights, break clauses)
4. Intent_Company_research - Research company details (credibility, litigation history)
5. Intent_Transaction_Date_navigator - Extract or schedule transaction-related dates
6. Intent_Amendment_Abstraction - Extract new terms from lease amendments and identify changes
7. Intent_Sales_Listings_Comparison - Compare pricing, sq ft, etc. across multiple sales listings
8. Intent_Lease_Listings_Comparison - Compare lease listings to identify best terms and conditions

## Instructions
1. Analyze the email content carefully
2. Consider the primary request being made
3. Identify keywords and phrases that signal specific intents
4. Classify the email into exactly ONE of the eight intent categories
5. Return ONLY the intent category as a single line response (e.g., "Intent_Lease_Abstraction")
